# 🧱 Blockchain Simulator

A **Java-based Blockchain Simulator** that demonstrates the core concepts behind blockchain technology — including **block creation**, **transaction validation**, **mining**, and **network simulation**.  
This project is designed for educational and experimental purposes, allowing developers and students to understand how blockchain works at a low level.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🪙 **Transaction Management:** Create, validate, and broadcast transactions across the simulated network.
- ⛏️ **Mining Simulation:** Mimics the Proof-of-Work mechanism with block difficulty and hash generation.
- 🔗 **Block Creation:** Dynamically generates blocks containing verified transactions.
- 🌐 **Network Simulation:** Simulates peer-to-peer communication between blockchain nodes.
- 🧩 **Data Integrity:** Uses cryptographic hashing to ensure immutability of blocks.
- 📊 **Visualization (Optional):** Includes diagram and output folders for analyzing blockchain structure.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **Language:** Java
- **IDE:** IntelliJ IDEA (recommended)
- **Version Control:** Git
- **Dependencies:** (if applicable, add external libraries used in `lib/` folder)

## 🧩 How It Works

1. Users create and broadcast transactions.
2. Miners pick up transactions and start the mining process.
3. When a valid proof is found, the block is added to the chain.
4. The blockchain synchronizes across simulated peers to maintain consistency.
5. Results and statistics are saved in the `output/` folder.

## 🖥️ How to Run

### ▶️ Option 1: Using IntelliJ IDEA
1. Open IntelliJ IDEA.
2. Click **File → Open** and select the `Blockchain_Simulator` project folder.
3. Build and run the project using the **Run** button or `Shift + F10`.

### 🧰 Option 2: Using Command Line
```bash
cd Blockchain_Simulator/src
javac Main.java
java Main
```

---

## 📂 Output

All simulation logs, generated blocks, and transaction data are stored inside the `output/` folder.  
Use these to analyze block structure and validate the chain integrity.
